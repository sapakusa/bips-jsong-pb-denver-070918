    "# Block Version\n",
    "\n",
    "Version in normal software refers to a particular state. That is, a particular version reflects a particular set of features. For a block, this is similar, in the sense that the version field reflects what capabilities the software that produced the block is ready for. In the past this was used as a way to indicate a single feature that was ready. Version 2 meant that the software was ready for BIP0016, or pay-to-script-hash as described previously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, this means that only one feature may be signaled on the network at a time. To alleviate this, the developers came up with BIP9, which allows up to 29 different features to be signaled at the same time. The way this works is discussed later."

    "### Signalling BIP Readiness\n",
    "\n",
    "Signalling simply means the miner of a block has set a bit in the version field to say that they support something. BIP 8 and 9 discuss this, it allows the miners to let the network know they are ready for the change or not. The version field of a block is 32 bits long, and if the top 3 bits are set to '001', 29 bits are free to be used for signalling.\n",
    "\n",
    "After a certain start time defined for a particular proposal, miners can set the bit specified to signal their support. It is during this time that if at least a certain percentage of blocks are mined with the bit set in one difficulty retarget period (2016 blocks), specified as the threshold needed, that proposal becomes LOCKED_IN. Once it is locked in, it is ready to become active in the network. Locked in just means that it gained enough support to proceed.\n",
